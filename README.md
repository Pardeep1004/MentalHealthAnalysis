**Analysis of Mental Health Datasets and Regression Modeling**
**Overview**
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for performing a comprehensive analysis of multiple datasets related to mental health using the Plotly library. The analysis includes data visualization, statistical summaries, and linear regression modeling. The goal is to gain insights into the prevalence of mental illnesses and their relationships with various factors.

**Code Structure**
The notebook is structured as follows:

**Importing Required Libraries:** Importing necessary Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and scikit-learn modules.
**Loading Datasets:** Loading multiple datasets (Data_1, Data_2, Data_3, Data_4) containing information on mental illnesses prevalence, adult population covered, depressive symptoms, and countries with primary data on the prevalence of mental illnesses.

**Describing Datasets:** Utilizing the describe() function to generate statistical summaries for each dataset.

**Visualizations with Plotly:** Creating various visualizations using Plotly, such as bar charts and scatter plots, to explore the relationships between different variables across datasets.

**Correlation Analysis:** Calculating and visualizing the correlation matrix between variables related to mental illnesses.
**
Regression Modeling:** Implementing linear regression modeling to predict the prevalence of eating disorders based on other mental health variables. This includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of model predictions.

**Additional Analysis:** Conducting additional analysis, such as higher-dimensional regression modeling and feature engineering.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the regression model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared score.

**Visualization of Model Output:** Visualizing the actual and predicted values of the target variable (eating disorders) against various predictor variables using scatter plots.
**
